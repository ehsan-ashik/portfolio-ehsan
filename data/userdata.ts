    "I'm a **former software engineer** and **current PhD candidate** in Univerity of Connecticut with a passion for learning, building, and problem-solving. My journey began in computer science, where I discovered the transformative power of programming and developed confidence through hands-on projects like a [GUI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://ehsan-ashik.github.io/tic-tac-toe-unity-game/) and a [3D model of the Taj Mahal](https://github.com/ehsan-ashik/Tajmahal-3D-renderer/blob/main/rendered%20images/white-light-2.PNG).",

    "In my career, I progressed from software engineer to senior roles, mastering backend architecture, scalable code design, and agile methodologies while mentoring others along the way. My current research in usable security and privacy combines my technical skills with a human-centered approach, exploring how people interact with security and privacy tools.",

    "I'm excited by new challenges and driven to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can create."
