# Personal Portfolio | Ehsan Ul Haque - Built with Next.js

This repository hosts the code for my personal portfolio, a responsive and dynamic web application built using Next.js. Check out the live version of the portfolio: https://ehsanulhaque.com/.

### Overview

The primary goal of developing this portfolio was to create a dynamic UI that decouples user data from the design. This approach transforms the portfolio into a versatile template: by simply updating the data within the data folder, anyone can generate their personalized portfolio while maintaining the original UI design.

### Features and Design Considerations

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The dynamic data is isolated from the UI logic, enabling the application to function as a customizable template.
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: The design is optimized to ensure seamless functionality and aesthetics across various device types.
3. **Reusable Components**: Common UI components are designed for reuse, promoting consistency and reducing code duplication.
